How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
That capacity help to identify the changes between different versions and thus help to spot any bug being introduced in new version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You could understand the impact from the changes from the different version to the performance of the program and learn from them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro: each version has meaningful changes 
Cro: addcidental loss during the change might causes issue

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to get the list of the versions for the files with comments on each updates
use git diff between two version (old, new) to find out the changes made in newer version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
This adds significant confidence to me to make changes that could break something, as there is easy way (git checkout) to reverse the change 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I will use Git to complete the assignment from Deep learning course.
